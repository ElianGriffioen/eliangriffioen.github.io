# Elian Griffioen

Hello, I am Elian Griffioen, second year Methodology & Statistics student at Utrecht University. Currently, I spend my time on a master thesis in which I try to find individualized donor strategies for anti-RhD donors. Anti-RhD antibodies are necessary to prevent haemolytic disease of the newborn, a disease that might occur when RhD-negative mothers are pregnant of a RhD-positive foetus. [Sanquin](https://www.sanquin.nl/en/), the Dutch National Blood Bank, collects these antibodies from a donor pool. My research focuses on deriving individual donor treatments based on their personal characteristics such that the total production of antibodies increases compared to the previous situation in which all donors share a similar treatment.

# More about me
Before my master in Methods & Statistics, I finished the bachelor programmes Chemistry and Psychology (both cum laude) at Utrecht University. I decided to go for statistics because of the combination of using advanced statistical methods based on mathematical foundations and researching real world problems. After one year of in depth courses about statistics like Statistical Programming in R, Bayesian Statistics, Multilevel and Structural Equation Modelling, I choose to focus my electives on data science and econometrics.Therefore, I followed elective courses on machine learning and data mining and joined courses in econometrics. Next to my thesis work, I am student assistant of [Rens van de Schoot](https://www.rensvandeschoot.com/elian-griffioen/) and helps with his work as a member of the [Young Academy](https://www.dejongeakademie.nl/en?set_language=en) in the field of scientific integrity. Furthermore, I am secretary of the [Young Statisticians](http://youngstatisticians.nl/index.html) Board, a group of people that aims to organize events for all statisticians in the Netherlands on a montly basis.

# My work

# Research

The research during my **Chemistry** bachelor thesis focused on **blue energy**, a method to gain energy by mixing salty sea and fresh river water. During the blue energy (capacitive mixing) cycle, a current flows through a system immersed in alternately salt and fresh water by charging and discharging porous carbon electrodes. Under adiabatic circumstances (no heat exchange with environment), heat effects during the charging steps were theoretically derived but not experimentally validated. Under supervision of dr. Ben Erné (Physical and Colloid Chemistry, Utrecht University) and prof. dr. René van Roij (Theoretical Physics, Utrecht University), I succesfully performed experiments to measure these adiabatic heat effects. The report on my work can be found [here](Blauwe energie - Eindversie bachelorthesis Elian Griffioen.pdf). Afterwards, a scientific publication is written about the theoretical derivation and experimental validation of adiabatic heat effects during the capacitive mixing cycle in blue energy that includes my experiments. The publication is published in Physical Review Letters and can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.00120.pdf).

I did my bachelor theis in Psychology at the **Methodology & Statistics** Department under supervision of dr. Rens van de Schoot. The research comprises the **prior-data conflict** in Bayesian statistics and **scientific integrity**. Firstly, I derived a method to convert judgements of experts on scientific integrity to a probability distribution (prior elicitation). Afterwards, I derived a statistical procedure to examine the presence of a big difference between the expert judgement and (artifical) data on scientific integrity from PhD candidates in the Netherlands and Belgium. This statistical procedure can be applied to all situations in which an expert tries to make judgement, for example on a number, proportion, correlation or outcome. As student assistant, I continued with this study and performed analyses of the prior-data conflict between experts judgements and real data on PhD candidates. The results will probably be published, so I cannot already show my bachelor thesis report here.
