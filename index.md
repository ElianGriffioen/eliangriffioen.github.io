## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ElianGriffioen/eliangriffioen.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Elian Griffioen

Hello, I am Elian Griffioen, second year Methodology & Statistics student at Utrecht University. Currently, I spend my time on a master thesis in which I try to find individualized donor strategies for anti-RhD donors. Anti-RhD antibodies are necessary to prevent haemolytic disease of the newborn, a disease that might occur when RhD-negative mothers are pregnant of a RhD-positive foetus. [Sanquin](https://www.sanquin.nl/en/), the Dutch National Blood Bank, collects these antibodies from a donor pool. My research focuses on deriving individual donor treatments based on their personal characteristics such that the total production of antibodies increases compared to the previous situation in which all donors share a similar treatment.
